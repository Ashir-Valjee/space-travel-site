## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

### Links

- Live Site URL: [https://space-travel-site-rho.vercel.app/](https://space-travel-site-rho.vercel.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned a lot from doing this project. My main takeaways are:

- grid-area is a very versatile tool when utilizing CSS grid.
- refactoring js to make code reuseable.
- The importance of accesibility in websites. In particular adding a skip-to-content hidden accesibility link, which most major websites use.
- making use of aria attributes when selecting elements in javaScript.

### Continued development

This site would be well suited to be built in React or another framework. I chose to use vanilla js as i was mainly focussing on improving my CSS.
